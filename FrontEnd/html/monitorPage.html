                <p>•Mission: SWOT is a satellite designed to measure the topography of Earth's water surface, including oceans, rivers, lakes and reservoirs.
                    •Purpose: Its main objective is to provide accurate measurements of water storage in surface water bodies. These measurements help track changes in water level, which is essential for monitoring floods, droughts and water resource management

                <p>•	Mission: GPM is a satellite designed to measure and map precipitation around the world.
                    • Purpose: GPM collects data on the amount, intensity and distribution of rainfall. This is critical to understanding how water is distributed in the atmosphere and converted to precipitation at the surface, which has important implications for water management and the prediction of extreme weather events such as storms and droughts

                <p>•Mission: SMAP is a satellite that measures soil moisture on the Earth's surface.
                    • Purpose: SMAP provides data on soil moisture in different regions of the world. This is useful for understanding soil water availability, agriculture, drought and the water cycle in general. It can also help prevent floods and landslides

                <p>•Mission: The GRACE and GRACE-FO satellites work together to measure variations in Earth's gravity.
                    • Purpose: These satellites measure fluctuations in gravity caused by changes in water distribution on Earth, such as groundwater storage and mass redistribution from glaciers and ice sheets. This provides valuable information about the amount of water stored in different regions and how it is changing over time
