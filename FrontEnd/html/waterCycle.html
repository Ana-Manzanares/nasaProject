            <p>The water cycle is a natural process that constantly moves water around the Earth. Imagine water taking an exciting journey through five main stages. Let's follow the water's journey together!</p>

       <p>It all begins in the oceans, rivers, lakes, and even puddles. The Sun shines brightly and heats the water. When the water gets hot, it starts turning into water vapor, like the steam coming out of a boiling kettle. This stage is called "evaporation." The water rises into the sky as tiny particles of vapor.</p>
