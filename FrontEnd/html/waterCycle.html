                <h2>The water cycle is a natural process that constantly moves water around the Earth. Imagine water
                    taking
                    an exciting journey through five main stages.
                    Let's follow the water's journey together!</h2>

                <h1>1.Evaporation</h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>It all begins in the oceans, rivers, lakes, and even puddles. The Sun shines brightly and heats the
                    water.
                    When the water gets hot, it starts turning into water vapor, like the steam coming out of a boiling
                    kettle.
                    This stage is called "evaporation." The water rises into the sky as tiny particles of vapor.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="transpirationDiv">
            <div>
                <h1>2.Transpiration</h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Plants also play a part in the water cycle. They absorb water from the ground through their roots.
                    This water travels up the plant and eventually evaporates through tiny openings in their leaves.
                    This process is known as "transpiration." So, some of the water vapor in the air comes from plants!

        <div id="condesationdiv">
            <div>
                <h1>3.Condensation</h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The water vapor rises and meets the cold air up in the clouds. 
                    When the air is cold, the tiny vapor particles come together and turn back into water droplets. 
                    This is called "condensation." The water droplets gather in the clouds, like a bunch of cotton in the sky.</p>
            </div>

        <div id="Precipitationdiv">
            <div>
                <h1>4.Precipitation</h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The clouds get heavier and heavier with all the water droplets.
                     When the clouds can't hold any more water, the droplets fall back to Earth. 
                     This is what we call "precipitation." It can be in the form of rain, snow, hail, or even drizzle.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="Accumulationdiv">
            <div>
                <h1>5.Accumulation</h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The falling water droplets reach the Earth and move into oceans, rivers, and lakes, where it all begins again. They can also soak into the ground and become groundwater that we can find in wells.
                     This stage is called "accumulation" because the water is gathering again in Earth's water bodies.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>And there you have it! That's the water cycle, including how plants contribute through transpiration.
                 Water travels from the oceans to the atmosphere, from plants to the sky, and back to Earth over and over again. 
                It's a continuous process and vital to keeping our planet with fresh, clean water for everyone to drink and use. It's like a never-ending adventure of water through nature!</p>
